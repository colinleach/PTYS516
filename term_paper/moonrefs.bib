	abstract     = {Of the several near-Earth and Main Belt asteroids visited by spacecraft to date, three display a paucity of small craters and an enhanced number of smoothed and degraded craters: 433 Eros, which has a deficit of craters ≲100 m in diameter; 2867 Šteins, which has a deficit of craters ≲500 m in diameter; and 25143 Itokawa, which has a deficit of craters ≲100 m in diameter. The purpose of this work was to investigate and model topographic modification and crater erasure due to impact-induced seismic shaking, as well as impact-driven regolith production and loss, on these asteroid surfaces. To perform this study, we utilized the numerical, three-dimensional, Cratered Terrain Evolution Model (CTEM) initially presented in J. E. Richardson, Icarus 204 (2009), which received a small-body (SB) specific update for this work. SBCTEM simulations of the surface of 433 Eros correctly reproduce its observed cratering record (for craters up to ∼3 km in diameter) at a minimum Main Belt exposure age of 225±75 Myr using a ‘very weak rock’ target strength of 0.5–5.0 MPa, and producing a mean regolith depth of 80±20 m, which agrees with published estimates of an actual regolith layer “tens of meters” in depth. SBCTEM simulations of the surface of 2867 Šteins correctly reproduce its heavily softened cratering record at a minimum Main Belt exposure age of 175±25 Myr using a ‘weak rock’ target strength of 2.5–5.0 MPa. Extending this simulation produces a mean regolith depth of 155±5 m at a minimum Main Belt exposure age of 475±25 Myr, in good agreement with the 145±35 m actual mean regolith depth estimated from two chains of drainage-pit craters on the surface, with both crater density and regolith depth in an equilibrium state. SBCTEM simulations of the surface of 25143 Itokawa correctly reproduce its extremely sparse cratering record at a minimum Main Belt exposure age of 20±5 Myr, using a ‘soft soil’ target strength of 10-20 kPa, and producing a mean regolith overturn depth of 5.0±1.0 m, given that Itokawa is composed entirely of regolith and boulders. These simulations demonstrate the efficacy of impact-induced seismic shaking to erase small craters on the surface of asteroids ≲25 km mean diameter, correctly reproducing their observed cratering records while using a Main Belt impactor population and standard crater scaling relationships. These simulations also show that the observed regolith layer on asteroids in the 5-50 km size range can be generated entirely through impact cratering processes, and indicate that regolith depth can be used as a additional constraint on the surface age of a given asteroid.}

	abstract     = {Abstract— The global high-resolution imaging of asteroid 433 Eros by the Near-Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) Shoemaker spacecraft has made it possible to develop the first comprehensive picture of the geology of a small S-type asteroid. Eros displays a variety of surface features, and evidence of a substantial regolith. Large scale facets, grooves, and ridges indicate the presence of at least one global planar structure. Directional and superposition relations of smaller structural features suggest that fracturing has occurred throughout the object. As with other small objects, impact craters dominate the overall shape as well as the small-scale topography of Eros. Depth/diameter ratios of craters on Eros average ∼0.13, but the freshest craters approach lunar values of ∼0.2. Ejecta block production from craters is highly variable; the majority of large blocks appear to have originated from one 7.6 km crater (Shoemaker). The interior morphology of craters does not reveal the influence of discrete mechanical boundaries at depth in the manner of craters formed on lunar mare regolith and on some parts of Phobos. This lack of mechanical boundaries, and the abundant evidence of regolith in nearly every high-resolution image, suggests a gradation in the porosity and fracturing with depth. The density of small craters is deficient at sizes below ∼200 m relative to predicted slopes of empirical saturation. This characteristic, which is also found on parts of Phobos and lunar highland areas, probably results from the efficient obliteration of small craters on a body with significant topographic slopes and a thick regolith. Eros displays a variety of regolith features, such as debris aprons, fine-grained “ponded” deposits, talus cones, and bright and dark streamers on steep slopes indicative of efficient downslope movement of regolith. These processes serve to mix materials in the upper loose fragmental portion of the asteroid (regolith). In the instance of “ponded” materials and crater wall deposits, there is evidence of processes that segregate finer materials into discrete deposits. The NEAR observations have shown us that surface processes on small asteroids can be very complex and result in a wide variety of morphologic features and landforms that today seem exotic. Future missions to comets and asteroids will surely reveal still as yet unseen processes as well as give context to those discovered by the NEAR Shoemaker spacecraft.}

Scientists across broad disciplines are increasingly recognizing that understanding asteroids is essential to discerning the basic processes of planetary formation, including how their current distribution bespeaks our solar system’s cataclysmic past. For explorers, the nearest asteroids beckon as the most accessible milestones in interplanetary space, offering spaceflight destinations easier to reach than the lunar surface. For futurists, the prospects of asteroids as commercial resources tantalize as a twenty-first-century gold rush, albeit with far greater challenges than faced by nineteenth-century pioneers. For humanity, it is the realization that asteroids matter. It is not a question of if—but when—the next major impact will occur. While the disaster probabilities are thankfully small, fully cataloging and characterizing the potentially hazardous asteroid population remains unfinished business.  Asteroids IV sets the latest scientific foundation upon which all these topics and more will be built upon for the future. Nearly 150 international authorities through more than 40 chapters convey the definitive state of the field by detailing our current astronomical, compositional, geological, and geophysical knowledge of asteroids, as well as their unique physical processes and interrelationships with comets and meteorites. Most importantly, this volume outlines the outstanding questions that will focus and drive researchers and students of all ages toward new advances in the coming decade and beyond.},

Other examples include their estimated bulk densities where Phobos has a density of ∼1.876 g/cm3 and Deimos has a lower and less certain density of ∼1.48 g/cm3. Imaging data reveals a low albedo of both moons – Phobos: ∼0.07; Deimos: ∼0.08. Also, Phobos manifests distinct redder and bluer units, whereas the surface of Deimos is globally comparable to the Phobos redder units with localized streaks of brighter material. Further, the libration of Phobos suggests interior density distributions potentially ranging from a generally homogeneous interior to a slightly heterogeneous composition, whereas Deimos lacks sufficient evidence to estimate its interior density distribution. Both moons are mantled in a global equivalent of dozens to hundreds of meters of regolith deposits, yet they differ in their surface characteristics. Other than scattered boulders and an underabundance of fresh craters, the surface of Deimos is generally smooth with most observable impact craters filled with regolith. Conversely, thousands of boulders are observed on Phobos, and the moon is heavily modified by larger craters that are crosscut by grooves and mantled with regolith deposits and smaller generally fresh and unfilled craters. Yet models that focus on many key questions are inadequately supported by definitive evidence, or lack definitive evidence altogether – and these questions must be considered open. For example, how were Deimos and Phobos produced? Where are their geological histories similar, and where do they diverge? Why are the global densities of Deimos and Phobos different from each other, and why are these densities less than typical rocky bodies? What are their present-day geochemical compositions, density distributions, and deeper interior structures? What are the natures of the Phobos red and blue surface units? When did the Stickney Crater (\$D {\textbackslash}sim 9\$ km) impact take place on Phobos and how did the Stickney impact alter the surface and interior of Phobos? How and when were the Phobos grooves produced? Do large impact craters on Mars emplace observable deposits of martian ejecta on the martian moons? Finally, how might we collect definitive evidence to address these open questions?},

	abstract     = {The origin of the Martian moons, Phobos and Deimos, remains elusive. While the morphology and their cratered surfaces suggest an asteroidal origin1–3, capture has been questioned because of potential dynamical difficulties in achieving the current near-circular, near-equatorial orbits4,5. To circumvent this, in situ formation models have been proposed as alternatives6–9. Yet, explaining the present location of the moons on opposite sides of the synchronous radius, their small sizes and apparent compositional differences with Mars2 has proved challenging. Here, we combine geophysical and tidal-evolution modelling of a Mars–satellite system to propose that Phobos and Deimos originated from disintegration of a common progenitor that was possibly formed in situ. We show that tidal dissipation within a Mars–satellite system, enhanced by the physical libration of the satellite, circularizes the post-disrupted eccentric orbits in {\textless}2.7 Gyr and makes Phobos descend to its present orbit from its point of origin close to or above the synchronous orbit. Our estimate for Phobos’s maximal tidal lifetime is considerably less than the age of Mars, indicating that it is unlikely to have originated alongside Mars. Deimos initially moved inwards, but never transcended the co-rotation radius because of insufficient eccentricity and therefore insufficient tidal dissipation. Whereas Deimos is very slowly receding from Mars, Phobos will continue to spiral towards and either impact with Mars or become tidally disrupted on reaching the Roche limit in ≲39 Myr.},

Scientists across broad disciplines are increasingly recognizing that understanding asteroids is essential to discerning the basic processes of planetary formation, including how their current distribution bespeaks our solar system’s cataclysmic past. For explorers, the nearest asteroids beckon as the most accessible milestones in interplanetary space, offering spaceflight destinations easier to reach than the lunar surface. For futurists, the prospects of asteroids as commercial resources tantalize as a twenty-first-century gold rush, albeit with far greater challenges than faced by nineteenth-century pioneers. For humanity, it is the realization that asteroids matter. It is not a question of if—but when—the next major impact will occur. While the disaster probabilities are thankfully small, fully cataloging and characterizing the potentially hazardous asteroid population remains unfinished business.  Asteroids IV sets the latest scientific foundation upon which all these topics and more will be built upon for the future. Nearly 150 international authorities through more than 40 chapters convey the definitive state of the field by detailing our current astronomical, compositional, geological, and geophysical knowledge of asteroids, as well as their unique physical processes and interrelationships with comets and meteorites.

We assume a disk with an initial mass of 1018kg (Craddock, R.A. [2011]. Icarus 211, 1150–1161). In the strong tide regime, the disk loses its material by viscous spreading inward to and outward from the planet. When outward moving material crosses the Roche limit, small-sized moonlets are accreted from gravitational instabilities with a shape and density similar to Phobos and Deimos. Due to the gravitational torque exerted by the disk, the moonlets migrate away from the planet, though they cannot reach the synchronous orbit (lying at 6 Mars’ radii). After the disk has lost most of its mass they rapidly fall back onto Mars due to the tidal decay of their orbits. Although, the total mass of moonlets is comparable to the mass of Phobos, their survival time does not exceed 200Ma, which is incompatible with the formation of Phobos and Deimos early in Mars’ history. In the weak tide regime, moonlets can accrete near the synchronous orbit with the mass of Deimos in a disk of up to 1018kg (similarly to planetary embryos formation in the protoplanetary disk). A Phobos-mass embryo can also be formed in the same disk but closer to Mars (at 3–4 Mars’ radii) so that it rapidly falls back onto Mars by tidal decay of its orbit. However, several embryos may accrete together in the disk (similarly to the final stage of terrestrial planet formation), and Phobos and Deimos may be the last two remnants of those bodies formed near the synchronous distance to Mars. Further investigations are still needed to understand such accretion mechanism within a circum-martian disk primarily extending below the synchronous orbit.},

The capture scenario mainly relies on the remote-sensing observations of their surfaces, which suggest that the moon material is similar to outer-belt asteroid material. This scenario, however, requires high tidal dissipation rates inside the moons to account for their current orbits around Mars. Although the in situ formation scenarios have not been studied in great details, no observational constraints argue against them. Little attention has been paid to the internal structure of the moons, yet it is pertinent for explaining their origin. The low density of the moons indicates that their interior contains significant amounts of porous material and/or water ice. The porous content is estimated to be in the range of 30–60\% of the volume for both moons. This high porosity enhances the tidal dissipation rate but not sufficiently to meet the requirement of the capture scenario. On the other hand, a large porosity is a natural consequence of re-accretion of debris at Mars’ orbit, thus providing support to the in situ formation scenarios. The low density also allows for abundant water ice inside the moons, which might significantly increase the tidal dissipation rate in their interiors, possibly to a sufficient level for the capture scenario. Precise measurements of the rotation and gravity field of the moons are needed to tightly constrain their internal structure in order to help answering the question of the origin.},

		Abstract
		
		The origin and evolution of Martian moons have been intensively debated in recent years. It is proposed that Phobos and Deimos may originate directly from the splitting of an ancestral moon orbiting at around the Martian synchronous orbit. At this hypothetical splitting, the apocenter of the inner moon (presumed as Phobos) and the pericenter of the outer moon (presumed as Deimos) would coincide, in that, their semimajor axes would reside inside and outside the Martian synchronous orbit with nonzero eccentricities, respectively. However, the successive orbital evolution of the two moons is not studied. Here, we perform direct N -body orbital integrations of the moons, including the Martian oblateness of the J 2 and J 4 terms. We show that the two moons, while they precess, likely collide within ∼10 4 yr with an impact velocity of v imp ∼ 100–300 m s −1 (∼10–30 times moons’ escape velocity) and with an isotropic impact direction. The impact occurs around the apocenter and the pericenter of the inner and outer moons, respectively, where the timescale of this periodic orbital alignment is regulated by the precession. By performing additional impact simulations, we show that such a high-velocity impact likely results in a disruptive outcome, forming a debris ring at around the Martian synchronous orbit, from which several small moons would accrete. Such an evolutionary path would eventually form a different Martian moon system from the one we see today. Therefore, it seems unlikely that Phobos and Deimos are split directly from a single ancestral moon.

The expression of the latter is developed up to harmonic degree 5 to match the accuracy of the current observations. We match a number of current interior structure models to the recent measurements of the tidal parameters and derive estimations of the possible core radius, temperature profile, and attenuation in the Martian interior. Our estimation of the core radius is 1,820 ± 80 km, consistent with recent seismic measurements. The attenuation profiles in the Martian interior at the main tidal period of Phobos are similar between the considered models, giving a range for the degree-2 bulk tidal attenuation Q2 = 93.0 ± 8.40 but diverge at seismic frequencies. At seismic frequencies, model shear attenuation Qμ ranges between 100 and 4,000 in the lower mantle, so that a measurement of seismic shear attenuation could be used as an effective means for distinguishing between the models considered. Other constraints such as elastic lithosphere thickness and Chandler Wobble period favor a thicker elastic lithosphere and models with a frequency dependence α of the shear attenuation between 0.15 and 0.4. Improved constraints on the Martian interior should be possible with additional seismic and radio observations from the InSight mission.},

A broad absorption centered around 0.65μm within the red spectral units of both moons is detected, and this feature is also evident in telescopic, Pathfinder, and Phobos-2 observations of Phobos. A 2.8μm metal–OH combination absorption on both moons is also detected in the CRISM data, and this absorption is shallower in the Phobos blue unit than in the Phobos red unit and Deimos.

Two end-member hypotheses are presented to explain the spectral features on Phobos and Deimos. The first invokes the presence of highly desiccated Fe-phyllosilicate minerals indigenous to the bodies, and the second invokes Rayleigh scattering and absorption of small iron particles formed by exogenic space weathering processing, coupled with implantation of H from solar wind.

Phobos, in particular, could have evolved from a parabolic orbit into a circular orbit within the age of the solar system, but the time required to shift Deimos remains inordinately long. If the present evolutions are representative of the past, the two orbits will have, at some time in the past, intersected, but the present orbit of Deimos does not favor a strong gravitational interaction with Phobos. Possibly, Deimos was part of a larger object, perhaps the core of a primordial body containing a large ice mantle. If it were sufficiently massive, such a body would have remained outside of Phobos. The backward extrapolated orbits of both satellites lead to a quite similar origin. The orbital inclinations have undergone little evolution, and this remains a severe constraint on the capture hypothesis, unless the captured bodies were initially in orbits inclined to the ecliptic. This cannot be excluded, as numerous asteroid families lie in orbits inclined by 20° or more to the ecliptic, in particular as these objects lie preferentially toward the outer limits of the asteroid belt, contain a higher percentage of carbonaceous chondritic material, and are more likely to be perturbed by Jupiter into Mars-crossing orbits.},

	abstract     = {Despite many efforts an adequate theory describing the origin of Phobos and Deimos has not been realized. In recent years a number of separate observations suggest the possibility that the martian satellites may have been the result of giant impact. Similar to the Earth–Moon system, Mars has too much angular momentum. A planetesimal with 0.02 Mars masses must have collided with that planet early in its history in order for Mars to spin at its current rate (Dones, L., Tremaine, S. [1993]. Science 259, 350–354). Although subject to considerable error, current crater-scaling laws and an analysis of the largest known impact basins on the martian surface suggest that this planetesimal could have formed either the proposed 10,600 by 8500-km-diameter Borealis basin, the 4970-km-diameter Elysium basin, the 4500-km-diameter Daedalia basin or, alternatively, some other basin that is no longer identifiable. It is also probable that this object impacted Mars at a velocity great enough to vaporize rock ({\textgreater}7km/s), which is necessary to place large amounts of material into orbit. If material vaporized from the collision with the Mars-spinning planetesimal were placed into orbit, an accretion disk would have resulted. It is possible that as material condensed and dissipated beyond the Roche limit forming small, low-mass satellites due to gravity instabilities within the disk. Once the accretion disk dissipated, tidal forces and libration would have pulled these satellites back down toward the martian surface. In this scenario, Phobos and Deimos would have been among the first two satellites to form, and Deimos the only satellite formed—and preserved—beyond synchronous rotation. The low mass of Phobos and Deimos is explained by the possibility that they are composed of loosely aggregated material from the accretion disk, which also implies that they do not contain any volatile elements. Their orbital eccentricity and inclination, which are the most difficult parameters to explain easily with the various capture scenarios, are the natural result of accretion from a circum-planetary disk.},

Recent studies have both analytically estimated debris produced by giant impacts on Mars and numerically examined the evolution of circum-Mars debris disks. We perform a numerical study (Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics simulation) of debris retention from giant impacts onto Mars, particularly in relation to a Borealis-scale giant impact (E∼3×1029J) capable of producing the Borealis basin. We find that a Borealis-scale impact is capable of producing a disk of mass ∼5×1020kg (∼1–4\% of the impactor mass), sufficient debris to form at least one of the martian moons according to recent numerical studies of martian debris disk evolution. While a Borealis-scale impact may generate sufficient debris to form both Phobos and Deimos, further studies of the debris disk evolution are necessary. Our results can serve as inputs for future studies of martian debris disk evolution.},

Using a hybrid N-body model of moon accumulation that includes a full treatment of moon-moon dynamical interactions, we first identify new constraints on the disk properties needed to produce Phobos and Deimos. We then simulate the impact formation of disks using smoothed particle hydrodynamics, including a novel approach that resolves the impact ejecta with order-of-magnitude finer mass resolution than existing methods. We find that forming Phobos-Deimos requires an oblique impact by a Vesta-to-Ceres sized object with {\textasciitilde}10−3 times Mars’ mass, a much less massive impactor than previously considered.},

	abstract     = {The Martian moons Phobos and Deimos may have accreted from a ring of impact debris, but explaining their origin from a single giant impact has proven difficult. One clue may lie in the orbit of Phobos that is slowly decaying as the satellite undergoes tidal interactions with Mars. In about 70 million years, Phobos is predicted to reach the location of tidal breakup and break apart to form a new ring around the planet. Here we use numerical simulations to suggest that the resulting ring will viscously spread to eventually deposit about 80\% of debris onto Mars; the remaining 20\% of debris will accrete into a new generation of satellites. Furthermore, we propose that this process has occurred repeatedly throughout Martian history. In our simulations, beginning with a large satellite formed after a giant impact with early Mars, we find that between three and seven ring–satellite cycles over the past 4.3 billion years can explain Phobos and Deimos as they are observed today. Such a scenario implies the deposition of significant ring material onto Mars during each cycle. We hypothesize that some anomalous sedimentary deposits observed on Mars may be linked to these periodic episodes of ring deposition.},

	abstract     = {All of the gas giants in our Solar System host ring systems, in contrast to the inner planets. One proposed mechanism of planetary ring formation is disruption or mass shedding of moons. The orbit of Phobos, the larger of Mars’s two moonlets, is gradually spiralling inwards towards Mars and the moon is experiencing increasing tidal stresses. Eventually, Phobos will either break apart to form a ring or it will crash into Mars. We evaluate these outcomes based on geologic, spectral and theoretical constraints, in conjunction with a geotechnical model that helps us determine the strength of Phobos. Our analysis suggests that much of Phobos is composed of weak, heavily damaged materials. We suggest that—with continued inward migration of the moon—the weakest material will disperse tidally in 20 to 40 million years to form a Martian ring. We predict that this ring will persist for 106 to 108 years and will initially have a comparable mass density to that of Saturn’s rings. Any large fragment of Phobos that is strong enough to escape tidal breakup will eventually collide with Mars in an oblique, low-velocity impact. Our analysis of the evolution of Phobos underscores the potential orbital and topographic consequences of the growth and self-destruction of other inwardly migrating moons, including those that met their demise early in our Solar System’s history.},

The ambient temperature under which asteroids formed is a crucial diagnostic to pinpoint the original location of asteroids and is potentially determined by the abundance of volatiles they contain. In particular, abundances and 13C/12C ratios of carbonates in meteorites record the abundances of carbon-bearing volatile species in their parent asteroids. However, the sources of carbon for these carbonates remain poorly understood5–8. Here we show that the Tagish Lake meteorite contains abundant carbonates with consistently high 13C/12C ratios. The high abundance of 13C-rich carbonates in Tagish Lake excludes organic matter as their main carbon source5,9. Therefore, the Tagish Lake parent body, presumably a D-type asteroid10, must have accreted a large amount of 13C-rich CO2 ice. The estimated 13C/12C and CO2/H2O ratios of ice in Tagish Lake are similar to those of cometary ice11,12. Thus, we infer that at least some D-type asteroids formed in the cold outer Solar System and were subsequently transported into the inner Solar System owing to an orbital instability of the giant planets1,3.},

In contrast, calculated histories of orbital evolution due to tides in the planet and in the satellites indicate that these small craggy moons originated on nearly circular, uninclined orbits not far from their current positions; hence dynamicists prefer an origin in circum-Martian orbit. Ways are described in which these apparently contradictory viewpoints may be reconciled, although a definitive answer to the origin of the Martian satellites will almost surely have to await in situ measurements.},

	abstract     = {Phobos and Deimos are the two small moons of Mars. Recent works have shown that they can accrete within an impact-generated disk. However, the detailed structure and initial thermodynamic properties of the disk are poorly understood. In this paper, we perform high-resolution SPH simulations of the Martian moon-forming giant impact that can also form the Borealis basin. This giant impact heats up the disk material (around ∼2000 K in temperature) with an entropy increase of ∼1500 J K−1 kg−1. Thus, the disk material should be mostly molten, though a tiny fraction of disk material () would even experience vaporization. Typically, a piece of molten disk material is estimated to be meter sized owing to the fragmentation regulated by their shear velocity and surface tension during the impact process. The disk materials initially have highly eccentric orbits (e ∼ 0.6–0.9), and successive collisions between meter-sized fragments at high impact velocity (∼1–5 km s−1) can grind them down to ∼100 μm sized particles. On the other hand, a tiny amount of vaporized disk material condenses into ∼0.1 μm sized grains. Thus, the building blocks of the Martian moons are expected to be a mixture of these different sized particles from meter-sized down to ∼100 μm sized particles and ∼0.1 μm sized grains. Our simulations also suggest that the building blocks of Phobos and Deimos contain both impactor and Martian materials (at least 35\%), most of which come from the Martian mantle (50–150 km in depth; at least 50\%). Our results will give useful information for planning a future sample return mission to Martian moons, such as JAXA’s MMX (Martian Moons eXploration) mission.},

	abstract     = {Phobos and Deimos are the two small Martian moons, orbiting almost on the equatorial plane of Mars. Recent works have shown that they can accrete within an impact-generated inner dense and outer light disk, and that the same impact potentially forms the Borealis basin, a large northern hemisphere basin on the current Mars. However, there is no a priori reason for the impact to take place close to the north pole (Borealis present location), nor to generate a debris disk in the equatorial plane of Mars (in which Phobos and Deimos orbit). In this paper, we investigate these remaining issues on the giant impact origin of the Martian moons. First, we show that the mass deficit created by the Borealis impact basin induces a global reorientation of the planet to realign its main moment of inertia with the rotation pole (True Polar Wander). This moves the location of the Borealis basin toward its current location. Next, using analytical arguments, we investigate the detailed dynamical evolution of the eccentric inclined disk from the equatorial plane of Mars that is formed by the Martian-moon-forming impact. We find that, as a result of precession of disk particles due to the Martian dynamical flattening J2 term of its gravity field and particle–particle inelastic collisions, eccentricity and inclination are damped and an inner dense and outer light equatorial circular disk is eventually formed. Our results strengthen the giant impact origin of Phobos and Deimos that can finally be tested by a future sample return mission such as JAXA’s Martian Moons eXploration mission.},

We show that a non-negligible amount of volatiles ({\textgreater}10\% of the vapor with temperature {\textgreater}1000 K via hydrodynamic escape, and moderately volatile dusts that condense at ∼700–2000 K via radiation pressure) could be removed just after the impact during their first single orbit from their pericenters to apocenters.

	abstract     = {The advent of double-Wien filter-selection-aperture and hexapole-collision-cell technologies coupled to laser ablation multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-MC-ICP-MS/MS) enables in situ analysis of 87Sr variations produced by the decay of radioactive 87Rb (t1/2 = 49.61 ± 0.16 Ga). We present methodologies to acquire in situ87Rb–87Sr data using a Thermo Scientific™ Neoma™ MC-ICP-MS coupled to a laser ablation system. The ions first pass through a mass filter that blocks ions outside of the Rb–Sr mass region. The ions then travel through a hexapole collision cell filled with SF6, inducing the fluorination of Sr+ to form SrF+. Strontium isotopes are measured as SrF+ free of interferences, while rubidium isotopes are measured as Rb+. Formulas are presented to calculate the error ellipses of 87Rb/86Sr and 87Sr/86Sr ratios corrected for instrumental fractionation by standard bracketing. While LA-MC-ICP-MS/MS is not as precise as Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometry (TIMS), it is less destructive and sample throughput is higher. It is therefore particularly well suited to analyze small and precious samples, or to examine population characteristics. We have analyzed several terrestrial and extraterrestrial materials to showcase the unique capabilities of LA-MC-ICP-MS/MS in Sr isotopic analyses: (1) an orthoclase megacryst and other minerals from the 397 Ma Shap granite, (2) feldspar grains from the 26.5 ka Oruanui supereruption in New Zealand, (3) Durango apatite, (4) highly refractory hibonite inclusions from the Murchison meteorite, and (5) the martian meteorite NWA 7034 also known as Black Beauty. Black Beauty is a polymict breccia that contains zircons as old as 4.4 Ga but whose 40Ar/39Ar age was partially reset at 1.4 Ga. All K-feldspar grains analyzed in Black Beauty give an 87Rb–87Sr age of 2.189 ± 0.059 Ga. Most likely, the 2.2 Ga 87Rb–87Sr age represents the age of lithification. This study demonstrates the great potential of in situ87Rb–87Sr dating for analyzing samples returned by planetary exploration missions, such as those currently collected by the Perseverance rover on Mars, or those that will be returned from Phobos by the MMX mission.},

The main objectives of this mission are to reveal the origin and evolution of Martian moons, the transport of volatile materials to terrestrial planets across the early solar system, and the dynamics and escape of the Martian atmosphere as evolutionary processes of a potentially habitable surface environment. The spacecraft to be launched in 2024 will reach the Mars-moons system after the cruise {\textasciitilde}1-year. Over subsequent {\textasciitilde}3-years, it will carry out close-up observations of Phobos, landings with sample collection, observations of Deimos, near-global imagings of Martian atmosphere, and measurements of ion and dust flux in circum-Martian space. Then, the spacecraft will leave the Mars-moons system and deliver samples to Earth in 2029. The landing operation will be performed in 2027 when the communication delay from the Earth will be relatively short. The periods before the landing operation will be used for detailed observations of Phobos to select landing sites. Telescope cameras (TENGOO and a bus camera), spectroscopic cameras (OROCHI and MIRS for visible and near IR, respectively), and a LIDAR will concentrate these observations. A rover released near a sampling site provides the geologic context of sample materials along with the close-up observations from the mothership. Gamma-ray and neutron spectrometers (MEGANE), ion mass spectrometer (MSA), and dust monitor (CMDM) will carry out observations in parallel for the further constraints on the moon's composition, the space weathering processes of the moon's surface, and circum-Martian dust environment. After the landing operation, detailed observations of important geological structures on Phobos, multiple flyby observations of Deimos, continuous imaging of Martian atmosphere, and observations of circum-Martian space will be carried out. The returned samples will be subjected to multifaceted cosmochemical analysis to determine the origin of Phobos and to constrain the early solar system processes that brought Phobos to Mars and the evolution of this moon. The samples are also likely to contain ejecta from relatively young Martian craters, which will be analyzed to constrain the conditions of the Martian surface in the near past.}

While orbital and large-scale characteristics of Phobos are relatively well known, characteristics of the surface regolith, including the particle size-distributions, the packing density, and the mechanical properties, are difficult to constrain.

Therefore, the history of the surface environment of Mars can be restored by analyzing the returned samples. Remote sensing of the Martian atmosphere and monitoring ions escaping to space while the spacecraft is orbiting Mars in the equatorial orbit are also planned. The camera with multi-wavelength filters and the infrared spectrometer onboard the spacecraft can monitor rapid transport processes of water vapor, dust, ice clouds, and other species, which could not be traced by the previous satellites on the sun-synchronous polar orbit. Such time-resolved pictures of the atmospheric phenomena should be an important clue to understand both the processes of water exchange between the surface/underground reservoirs and the atmosphere and the drivers of efficient material transport to the upper atmosphere. The mass spectrometer with unprecedented mass resolution can observe ions escaping to space and monitor the atmospheric escape which has made the past Mars to evolve towards the cold and dry surface environment we know today. Together with the above two instruments, it can potentially reveal what kinds of atmospheric events can transport tracers (e.g., H2O) upward and enhance the atmospheric escape.},

Touchdown operations are planned to be performed twice at different landing sites on the Phobos surface to collect {\textgreater} 10 g of the Phobos surface materials with coring and pneumatic sampling systems on board. The Sample Analysis Working Team (SAWT) of MMX is now designing analytical protocols of the returned Phobos samples to shed light on the origin of the Martian moons as well as the evolution of the Mars–moon system. Observations of petrology and mineralogy, and measurements of bulk chemical compositions and stable isotopic ratios of, e.g., O, Cr, Ti, and Zn can provide crucial information about the origin of Phobos. If Phobos is a captured asteroid composed of primitive chondritic materials, as inferred from its reflectance spectra, geochemical data including the nature of organic matter as well as bulk H and N isotopic compositions characterize the volatile materials in the samples and constrain the type of the captured asteroid. Cosmogenic and solar wind components, most pronounced in noble gas isotopic compositions, can reveal surface processes on Phobos. Long- and short-lived radionuclide chronometry such as 53Mn–53Cr and 87Rb–87Sr systematics can date pivotal events like impacts, thermal metamorphism, and aqueous alteration on Phobos. It should be noted that the Phobos regolith is expected to contain a small amount of materials delivered from Mars, which may be physically and chemically different from any Martian meteorites in our collection and thus are particularly precious. The analysis plan will be designed to detect such Martian materials, if any, from the returned samples dominated by the endogenous Phobos materials in curation procedures at JAXA before they are processed for further analyses.},

The resettling of grains and boulders following a cratering event, as well as observations made during small body missions, can provide clues regarding the material properties and the physical evolution of a surface. In order to analyze such events, it is necessary to understand how gravity influences granular behavior.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} In this work, we study slow impacts into granular materials for different collision velocities and gravity levels. Our objectives are to develop a model that describes the penetration depth in terms of the dimensionless Froude number and to use this model to understand the relationship between collision behavior, collision velocity, and gravity.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We used the soft-sphere discrete element method to simulate impacts into glass beads under gravitational accelerations ranging from 9.81 m s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−2{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} to 0.001 m s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−2{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}. We quantified collision behavior using the peak acceleration, the penetration depth, and the collision duration of the projectile, and we compared the collision behavior for impacts within a Froude number range of 0–10.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} The measured penetration depth and collision duration for low-velocity collisions are comparable when the impact parameters are scaled by the Froude number, and the presented model predicts the collision behavior well within the tested Froude number range. If the impact Froude number is low (0 {\textless} Fr {\textless} 1.5), the collision occurs in a regime that is dominated by a depth-dependent quasi-static friction force. If the impact Froude number is high enough (1.5 {\textless} Fr {\textless} 10), the collision enters a second regime that is dominated by inertial drag.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} The presented collision model can be used to constrain the properties of a granular surface material using the penetration depth measurement from a single impact event. If the projectile size, the collision velocity, the gravity level, and the final penetration depth are known and if the material density is estimated, then the internal friction angle of the material can be deduced.},

The MMX Rover will fly as a payload and will be jettisoned onto Phobos from a low altitude of about 40 metres. The rover has multiple objectives: terrain assessment to mitigate the risk for the sample-return approach of the spacecraft, exploration of the surface of Phobos and act as a scientific and technology demonstration platform. In this context, the Robotics and Mechatronics Institute, DLR, is preparing to perform an Autonomous Navigation Experiment as a technology demonstration to showcase the advantages of robot autonomy for exploring distant celestial bodies.

	abstract     = {Phobos is one of the two moons of Mars, the only other terrestrial planet to have companions. In spite of certain common orbital characteristics between Earth’s Moon and Phobos, such as almost circular, low-inclination, and synchronous orbits, the origin of the Martian moons remains to be understood. This unsettled state of affairs reflects a scarcity of data pertinent to its interior structure and bulk composition, both of which hold the key to solving the question of the provenance of the satellites. Drawing on the importance of interior structure as a means of providing further constraints on this problem, we construct a series of models of the interior of Phobos in accordance with current observations and determine their tidal deformation. The models include a homogeneous body, ice-rock mixtures, models with positive and negative density gradients, and layered models. To compute the deformation of Phobos precisely, we solve the three-dimensional elastostatic problem to obtain the full displacement field. For this, we rely on a higher-order spectral-element method and to account for a correct representation of shape and resulting displacement field, we accurately mesh the figure of Phobos by employing the digital terrain model of Willner et al. (2014). To enable us to further distinguish between models, we also rely on currently available geophysical data (e.g., magnitude of libration in longitude, mean density, gravity field, and moments of inertia). Our results show that the homogeneous, ice-rock mixture, and negative density gradient models are largely degenerate and therefore difficult to separate, but that models with a density increase with depth can be differentiated from the former model families. From a purely deformational point of view, we find that for positive gradient and layered models, the largest deformation occurs on the rim of the Stickney crater, rather than immediately at the sub-Mars point on Phobos, as in the case of the other models, where tidal forces are largest. These observations will be of considerable interest and should provide important anchoring points for the future exploration of Phobos as envisaged with the Martian Moons Exploration mission.},

In situ Raman spectroscopy on Phobos is an important tool to achieve the scientific objectives of the Martian Moons eXploration (MMX) mission, and maximize the scientific merit of the sample return by characterizing the mineral composition and heterogeneity of the surface of Phobos. Conducting in situ Raman spectroscopy in the harsh environment of Phobos requires a very sensitive, compact, lightweight, and robust instrument that can be carried by the compact MMX rover. In this context, the Raman spectrometer for MMX (i.e., RAX) is currently under development via international collaboration between teams from Japan, Germany, and Spain. To demonstrate the capability of a compact Raman system such as RAX, we built an instrument that reproduces the optical performance of the flight model using commercial off-the-shelf parts. Using this performance model, we measured mineral samples relevant to Phobos and Mars, such as anhydrous silicates, carbonates, and hydrous minerals. Our measurements indicate that such minerals can be accurately identified using a RAX-like Raman spectrometer. We demonstrated a spectral resolution of approximately 10 cm−1, high enough to resolve the strongest olivine Raman bands at {\textasciitilde} 820 and {\textasciitilde} 850 cm−1, with highly sensitive Raman peak measurements (e.g., signal-to-noise ratios up to 100). These results strongly suggest that the RAX instrument will be capable of determining the minerals expected on the surface of Phobos, adding valuable information to address the question of the moon’s origin, heterogeneity, and circum-Mars material transport.},

We present a broad assessment of potential scientific investigations, as well as strategic and operational opportunities offered by long-term operation of an instrumented lander. Studies using observations of Mars’ moons, and the detailed new findings expected from the JAXA Martian Moons eXploration (MMX) mission, International Mars Sample Return (MSR) Campaign and other upcoming Mars missions, provide a driver for feasibility and trade studies for follow-on missions that would build on the knowledge gain from those missions. We discuss the scientific questions and operational objectives that may be pertinent for landed platforms on the martian moons, including (1) monitoring and scientific investigations of Mars’ surface and atmosphere, (2) scientific investigations of the martian moons, (3) monitoring and scientific investigations of the space environment, (4) data relay for Mars surface assets or interplanetary missions and 5) use in a Mars navigation/positioning system. We present results from visibility calculations performed using the SPICE observation geometry system for space science missions, and a Phobos shape model. We compute as a function of location on Phobos, visibility quantities that are most relevant to science and operational objectives. These include visibility from Phobos of the Sun, Earth, Mars surface and atmosphere, Deimos, and Jupiter. We also consider occultation events by the Mars atmosphere of Earth and Deimos that may provide opportunities for radio science. Calculations are performed for a study period spanning one Mars year in a hypothetical future operational scenario (1 Jan 2030–18 Nov 2031). We combine visibility metrics to identify locations on Phobos most suitable for long-term operation of a platform. We find the Mars-facing side of Phobos, and limited areas on the leading and trailing sides, satisfy the most requirements defined for Mars and Phobos science, space environment monitoring, and data relay/navigation. We demonstrate that compliance with requirements related to visibility of Mars and its atmosphere are not mutually exclusive with those that are better satisfied on Phobos’ anti-Mars side, such as those aided by maximizing their cumulative view factor to the ecliptic plane (i.e. visibility to the Sun, Earth or outer solar system). Finally, our methodology allows to assess the extent to which combined visibility metrics can meet mission requirements. The process we describe can be used to support landing site identification and selection on planets, moons and small bodies.},

	abstract     = {Martian Moons eXploration (MMX) is a mission under development in JAXA in cooperation with NASA, CNES, ESA, DLR to be launched in 2024. This paper introduces the result of its preliminary design and the latest status of the MMX program, putting more weight on the novel part of the mission. The goal of MMX is to reveal the origin of the Martian moons and then to make progress in our understanding of planetary system formation and of primordial material transport around the border between the inner- and the outer part of the early solar system. Additionally, the mission is to survey two Martian moons and return samples from Phobos. Add to those MMX's contribution to the planetary science field, on the growing discussion on the International Space Exploration activities, MMX's contribution to future human Mars exploration is also considered as an essential aspect of the program. Following the system definition study results presented in the previous conference, the following items will be reported in this paper. First, as a result of the comprehensive completion of the Phase-B activities, the preliminary design is completed in coordination with the design of the spacecraft system, mission instruments, and operation plans. This paper describes the proximity and surface operations around Phobos in detail. Second, Phase-C activities have started, incorporating engineering models manufacturing and tests. Those of critical technologies for surface exploration are described in detail. Moreover third, the programmatic aspects, including international cooperation frameworks and the program schedule, are presented.},

The CMDM is a newly developed instrument that is an impact dust detector. It weighs only 650 g and has a sensor aperture area of ∼1 m{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}, according to the conceptual design study. Detectable velocities (v) range from 0.5 km/s to more than 70 km/s, which will cover all possible dust particles: circummartian (low v), interplanetary (mid v), and interstellar (high v) particles. The measurable mass ranges from 1.3 × 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-9{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} g to 7.8 × 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-7{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} g at v = 0.5 km/s. Since the MMX spacecraft will take a quasi-circular, prograde orbit around Mars, the CMDM will be able to investigate particles from Phobos and Deimos with relative velocities lower than 1 km/s. Therefore, the CMDM will be able to determine whether or not a confined dust ring exists along Phobos' orbit and whether an extended dust torus exists along Deimos' orbit. It may also be able to clarify whether or not any such ring or torus are self-sustained.},

To accomplish its measurements, MEGANE will use a high-purity Ge gamma-ray spectrometer (GRS), and a neutron spectrometer (NS) that consists of two 3He gas proportional neutron sensors.

It is a low-gravity object moderately inside the gravity well of Mars. Scientifically, it is both an enigma and an opportunity: an enigma because the origins of both it and Deimos are uncertain, and provide insights into formation of the terrestrial planets; and an opportunity because Phobos may be a waypoint or staging point for future human exploration of the Mars system. Phobos is a low albedo, spectrally bland body with a red-sloped continuum. It appears similar to D-type objects more commonly found in the outer asteroid belt and Jovian space (Rivkin et al., 2002), but occurs in an orbit that is difficult to explain by capture (Burns, 1992). It might have a primitive composition like that inferred for outer solar system objects or it could be related to Mars and, for example, be composed of Martian basin ejecta. Regardless, Phobos has acted as a witness plate to Martian debris over the age of the solar system. The moons may possibly be a source of in situ resources that could support future human exploration in circum-Mars space or on the Martian surface. in situ compositional analyses can address many questions relevant to preparation for future human exploration. Sample return resolves those questions while also enabling detailed analyses in terrestrial laboratories to address higher order questions, many of which have not yet been asked.},

	abstract     = {Impacts on planetary bodies can lead to both prompt secondary craters and projectiles that reimpact the target body or nearby companions after an extended period, producing so-called “sesquinary” craters. Here we examine sesquinary cratering on the moons of Mars. We model the impact that formed Voltaire, the largest crater on the surface of Deimos, and explore the orbital evolution of resulting high-velocity ejecta across 500years using four-body physics and particle tracking. The bulk of mass transfer to Phobos occurs in the first 102years after impact, while reaccretion of ejecta to Deimos is predicted to continue out to a 104year timescale (cf. Soter, S. [1971]. Studies of the Terrestrial Planets. Cornell University). Relative orbital geometry between Phobos and Deimos plays a significant role; depending on the relative true longitude, mass transfer between the moons can change by a factor of five. Of the ejecta with a velocity range capable of reaching Phobos, 25–42\% by mass reaccretes to Deimos and 12–21\% impacts Phobos. Ejecta mass transferred to Mars is {\textless}10\%. We find that the characteristic impact velocity of sesquinaries on Deimos is an order of magnitude smaller than those of background (heliocentric) hypervelocity impactors and will likely result in different crater morphologies. The time-averaged flux of Deimos material to Phobos can be as high as 11\% of the background (heliocentric) direct-to-Phobos impactor flux. This relatively minor contribution suggests that spectrally red terrain on Phobos (Murchie, S., Erard, S. [1996]. Icarus 123, 63–86) is not caused by Deimos material. However the high-velocity ejecta mass reaccreted to Deimos from a Voltaire-sized impact is comparable to the expected background mass accumulated on Deimos between Voltaire-size events. Considering that the high-velocity ejecta contains only 0.5\% of the total mass sent into orbit, sesquinary ejecta from a Voltaire-sized impact could feasibly resurface large parts of the Moon, erasing the previous geological record. Dating the surface of Deimos may be more challenging than previously suspected.},

	abstract = {The role of tidal dissipation within the Martian satellite system is examined through orbital evolution integrations and assessed in the context of its origin scenario through calculations of collision probabilities between Phobos and Deimos in the distant past. A wide range of assumptions concerning models of dissipation by anelastic tidal deformation within Mars and its satellites has been considered in investigating the possibility of a capture origin using generalized Q laws and the Darwin-Kaula formulation of the secular evolution equations. The integration of the equations of evolution confirms a previous finding (P. Goldreich, Mon. Not. Roy. Astron. Soc. 126, 257–268, 1963; S. F. Singer, Trans. Amer. Geophys. Union 51, 637–641, 1970; K. Lambeck, J. Geophys. Res. 84, 5651–5658, 1979) that Deimos in its present form could not have been captured. Calculations of collision probabilities provide further evidence against a capture origin, for if Phobos and Deimos were captured, they would most probably have collided at some stage. It seems reasonable to assume that a collision event would not have resulted in a highly regular Deimos orbit, even though Phobos could have been tidally evolved to its present orbit after a collision. An accretion origin is therefore preferred over capture, although an accretion model that is consistent with the likely carbonaceous chondritic composition of the Martian satellites has yet to be established. Constraints on the Q laws of Phobos can then be established on the assumption that a collision between Phobos and Deimos has not occurred in the past 1.5 billion years or longer, as indicated by their exposure ages (J. Veverka, Vistas Astron. 22, 163–192, 1978).},

However, the very surfaces that are observed by remote-sensing are also subject to impingement by micrometeoroids and solar wind particles, which are believed to play the dominant role in space weathering, which is the time-dependent modification of an asteroid's reflectance spectrum. Such space weathering has confused the interpretations of telescopic spectra of asteroids, especially concerning the possible association of common ordinary chondritic meteorites with so-called S-type asteroids. Recent spacecraft studies of asteroids (especially of Eros by NEAR-Shoemaker) have documented aspects of space weathering processes, but we still do not understand the physics of space weathering well enough to confidently assay mineralogy of diverse asteroids by remote-sensing. A review of the intellectual history of this topic reveals the complexity of interdisciplinary research on far-away astronomical bodies.},

The two best studied Asteroids (433 Eros and 243 Ida) exhibit quite different space weathering styles, and neither exhibits lunar-style space weathering. It must be concluded that at this time the diversity and mechanisms of asteroid space weathering are poorly understood. This introduces a significant unconstrained variable into the problem of analyzing asteroid spectral data. The sensitivity of asteroid surface material characterizations to space weathering effects – whatever their nature – is strongly dependent upon the choice of remote sensing methodology. The effects of space weathering on some methodologies such as curve matching are potentially devastating and at the present time essentially unmitigated. On other methodologies such as parametric analysis (e.g., analyses based on band centers and band area ratios) the effects are minimal. By choosing the appropriate methodology(ies) applied to high quality spectral data, robust characterizations of asteroid surface mineralogy can be obtained almost irrespective of space weathering. This permits sophisticated assessments of the geologic history of the asteroid parent bodies and of their relationships to the meteorites. Investigations of the diversity of space weathering processes on asteroid surfaces should be a fruitful area for future efforts.},

	abstract = {The two small asteroid-like bodies orbiting Mars, Phobos and Deimos, are low albedo and exhibit similar visible to near-infrared spectra. Determining the origin of these moons is closely tied to determining their composition. From available spectroscopic data Phobos exhibits two distinct types of materials across its surface, and data from both Mars Express and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter have provided additional details about the properties of these materials and their spatial relation to one another. Although no prominent diagnostic absorptions have been detected, systematic weak features are seen in some data. An extensive regolith is observed to have developed on both moons with characteristics that may be unique due to their special environment in Mars orbit. Understanding the character and evolution of the regolith of Phobos and Deimos is central to interpreting the moons׳ physical and optical properties. The cumulative data available for compositional analyses across the surface of Phobos and Deimos, however, remain incomplete in scope and character and ambiguous in interpretation. Consequently the composition of the moons of Mars remains uncertain.},

	abstract = {Phobos and Deimos will be spectral characterized by MIRS, imaging spectrometer on board of the MMX (Martian Moon eXploration) mission. MMX is an approved sample return mission by JAXA to explore the Martian system (Kuramoto et al. 2022, EPS 74, 12). The spacecraft will be launched in summer 2024, arriving into Mars orbit in 2025 and bringing back Phobos' sample ({\textgreater}10 g) to Earth in 2029. MMX spacecraft will be injected into Phobos co-orbit and then in orbit around Mars like a Martian Moon in the so called quasi-satellite orbits (QSOs). The QSOs will be settled at different altitudes in the equatorial plane of Phobos to observe Phobos at various resolution and select the two landing sites. Observations of the Martian atmosphere will be performed taking the advantage of the quasi-equatorial spacecraft orbits to study spatial and temporal atmosphere changes. Multiple flybys of Deimos will also be performed. One of the major mission goals is to understand the origin of the two moons, which will provide important constrains on planetary formation and on the material transport in the region connecting the inner and outer solar system. The origin of Phobos and Deimos is still a debated question. Past space missions and ground observations revealed that the properties of these two moons shared similarities with asteroids. Their red spectra, without strong absorption features, very different from those of Martian surface, are similar to those of primitive C-D-type asteroids. This similarity together with their characteristics of low albedo and low density, support the hypothesis of the captured asteroids. However their dynamical properties (low inclination and low eccentricity) and more recent numerical simulations seem to be more in favor of in-situ formation by a giant impact on Mars. To characterize the surface composition of the two moons at high spatial resolution and select the two Phobos sampling sites, MIRS will observe the two satellites in the 0.9-3.6 μm range with a spectral resolution better than 20 nm. MIRS will acquire spectra of Phobos at a spatial resolution of about 20 m during the Medium altitude survey (at altitude around 60 km) and of Deimos at spatial resolution of 100 m (at a distance of 300 km). The different landing sites on Phobos will be selected and observed at different resolutions. The high S/N ({\textgreater}100 up to 3.2 μm) and the unprecedented spatial resolution achieved by MIRS will permit to characterize the detailed composition to investigate the local heterogeneity associated with the different surface morphology. MIRS will characterize the surface composition by spectral signatures on both satellites, like hydrous silicate minerals (features at 2.7-2.8 μm, water (ice) (absorption bands at 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0-3.2 μm), minor overtones at 1.4 and 1.8 μm), or anhydrous silicates (bands in the 0.9-1.0 and 2.0 μm regions) as well organic matter (3.3-3.5 μm), if present. MIRS will also be able to measure the spectral radiance of the surface within the instrument footprint. The spectral thermal tail (from about 2.5 μm) will allow us to derive surface temperature variation and surface thermal inertia of Phobos. The MIRS data analysis will contribute to a better understanding of Phobos and Deimos with the characterization of the surface composition material (and subsurface through analysis of crater). The similarity to carbonaceous chondrites with the possible presence of organics and/or ices will imply a capture origin, while the presence, even if partially, of high-temperature phase materials representing a mixture from crust and mantle of Martian silicates would indicate a giant impact origin.},

MMX will make comprehensive remote-sensing measurements of both moons and return regolith samples from Phobos to Earth. Geodetic measurements of gravity, shape, and rotation parameter of a body provides constraints on its internal structure reflecting its origin and evolution. Moments of inertia are important parameters to constrain the internal mass distribution, but they have not been well determined for the Martian moons yet. We discuss the mission requirements related to the moments of inertia to detect a potential heterogeneity of the mass distribution inside Phobos. We introduce mission instruments and operational strategies to meet the mission requirements. We present a preliminary imaging strategy from a quasi-satellite orbit for a base shape model that is expected to be created at the early stage of the mission. Geodetic products including ephemeris, gravity field, rotation parameter of Phobos, and spacecraft orbit are of importance not only for the geodetic study, but also for interpreting data from various mission instruments and selecting possible landing sites.},

The mission involves scientific data collection and a sample return from Phobos, the bigger of the two Martian moons. The mission is scheduled to launch in the third quarter of 2024. The MMX Rover will fly as a payload and will be jettisoned onto Phobos from a low altitude of about 40 metres. The rover has multiple objectives: terrain assessment to mitigate the risk for the sample-return approach of the spacecraft, exploration of the surface of Phobos and act as a scientific and technology demonstration platform. In this context, the Robotics and Mechatronics Institute, DLR, is preparing to perform an Autonomous Navigation Experiment as a technology demonstration to showcase the advantages of robot autonomy for exploring distant celestial bodies.

	abstract = {The Imager for Mars Pathfinder (IMP) acquired four spectra of parts of the sub-Mars hemispheres of Phobos and Deimos. The measured region of Phobos is expected to be a mixture of the two spectral units identified on that satellite from Phobos 2 data, and the IMP spectra of Phobos are intermediate to the two units as expected. The derived geometric albedo is consistent with the value for that part of Phobos determined from Viking imagery. The IMP spectrum of Deimos is generally consistent with previous measurements acquired from the ground and from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), but the signal-to-noise ratio is lower than that of the Phobos data. The spectral contrast between the two moons is similar to that seen in HST and Phobos 2 data. Mars Pathfinder measurements therefore substantiate recent results which indicate that Phobos and Deimos are not, as previously believed, analogous to C-type asteroids. They also provide some indications for an absorption near 700 nm, perhaps like that seen in other low-albedo asteroids. Both Martian moons are redder than most asteroids, and most closely resemble two analog materials believed to have undergone very dissimilar histories: primitive D-like asteroids, and highly space-weathered, mafic-rich assemblages, such as are present in lunar mare soils.},

We find the trailing hemisphere of Phobos to be brighter than its leading hemisphere by 0.24±0.06 magnitude at 1.65 μm and brighter than Deimos by 0.98±0.07 magnitude at 1.65 μm. We see no difference larger than observational uncertainties in spectral slope between the leading and trailing hemispheres when the spectra are normalized to 1.65 μm. We find no 3-μm absorption feature due to hydrated minerals on either hemisphere to a level of ∼5–10\% on Phobos and ∼20\% on Deimos. When the infrared data are joined to visible and near-IR data obtained by previous workers, our data suggest the leading (Stickney-dominated) side of Phobos is best matched by T-class asteroids. The spectral slope of the trailing side of Phobos and leading side of Deimos are bracketed by the D-class asteroids. The best laboratory spectral matches to these parts of Phobos are mature lunar soils and heated carbonaceous chondrites. The lack of 3-μm absorption features on either side of Phobos argues against the presence of a large interior reservoir of water ice according to current models of Phobos' interior (F. P.

	abstract = {The Martian satellite Phobos has been observed on 2007 February 24 and 25, during the pre- and post-Mars closest approach (CA) of the ESA Rosetta spacecraft Mars swing-by. The goal of the observations was the determination of the surface composition of different areas of Phobos, in order to obtain new clues regarding its nature and origin. Near-ultraviolet, visible and near-infrared (263.5–992.0 nm) images of Phobos's surface were acquired using the Narrow Angle Camera of the OSIRIS instrument onboard Rosetta. The six multi-wavelength sets of observations allowed a spectrophotometric characterization of different areas of the satellite, belonging respectively to the leading and trailing hemisphere of the anti-Mars hemisphere, and also of a section of its sub-Mars hemisphere. The pre-CA spectrophotometric data obtained with a phase angle of 19° have a spectral trend consistent within the error bars with those of unresolved/disc-integrated measurements present in the literature. In addition, we detect an absorption band centred at 950 nm, which is consistent with the presence of pyroxene. The post-CA observations cover from NUV to NIR a portion of the surface (0° to 43°E of longitude) never studied before. The reflectance measured on our data does not fit with the previous spectrophotometry above 650 nm. This difference can be due to two reasons. First, the OSIRIS observed area in this observation phase is completely different with respect to the other local specific spectra and hence the spectrum may be different. Secondly, due to the totally different observation geometry (the phase angle ranges from 137° to 140°), the differences of spectral slope can be due to phase reddening. The comparison of our reflectance spectra, both pre- and post-CA, with those of D-type asteroids shows that the spectra of Phobos are all redder than the mean D-type spectrum, but within the spectral dispersion of other D-types. To complement this result, we performed an investigation of the conditions needed to collisionally capture Phobos in a way similar to that proposed for the irregular satellites of the giant planets. Once put in the context of the current understanding of the evolution of the early Solar system, the coupled observational and dynamical results we obtained strongly argue for an early capture of Phobos, likely immediately after the formation of Mars.},

The time scales for regularization of the orbital parameters are estimated, and found to be of the order of a few years. The atmosphere is modeled as a slowly-rotating condensation in the solar nebula; the surface pressure should be a few tenths of a bar. Capture and evolution by such an atmosphere are found to be improbable. The odds are greatly improved if the atmosphere is rapidly rotating or if the pressure is 1 to 2 orders of magnitude greater. Escape of the atmosphere, after removal of the nebular pressure, takes a few years, depending on the solar heat input. But it relaxes much more quickly to a state with negligible density at satellite altitudes. This relaxation is taken as the event that leaves the satellites in stable orbits. Previous candidates presumably were added to the solid body of Mars, and later ones were not captured.},

A broad absorption centered around 0.65μm within the red spectral units of both moons is detected, and this feature is also evident in telescopic, Pathfinder, and Phobos-2 observations of Phobos. A 2.8μm metal–OH combination absorption on both moons is also detected in the CRISM data, and this absorption is shallower in the Phobos blue unit than in the Phobos red unit and Deimos. The strength, position, and shape of both of the 0.65μm and 2.8μm absorptions are similar to features seen on red-sloped, low-albedo primitive asteroids. Two end-member hypotheses are presented to explain the spectral features on Phobos and Deimos. The first invokes the presence of highly desiccated Fe-phyllosilicate minerals indigenous to the bodies, and the second invokes Rayleigh scattering and absorption of small iron particles formed by exogenic space weathering processing, coupled with implantation of H from solar wind. Both end-member hypotheses may play a role, and in situ exploration will be needed to ultimately determine the underlying causes for the pair of spectral features observed on Phobos and Deimos.},

The known physical properties of the Martian moons (density, albedo, color and spectral reflectivity) are similar to those of many C-type asteroids, the dark "carbonaceous" objects abundant in the outer belt but scarce near Mars; thus this line of physical evidence suggests that Phobos and Deimos are captured bodies. In contrast, calculated histories of orbital evolution due to tides in the planet and in the satellites indicate that these small craggy moons originated on nearly circular, uninclined orbits not far from their current positions; hence dynamicists prefer an origin in circum-Martian orbit. Ways are described in which these apparently contradictory viewpoints may be reconciled, although a definitive answer to the origin of the Martian satellites will almost surely have to await in situ measurements.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the spectral modeling of the surface of Phobos in the wavelength range between 0.25 and 4.0 μm. We use complementary data to cover this spectral range: the OSIRIS (Optical, Spectroscopic, and Infrared Remote Imaging System on board the ESA Rosetta spacecraft) reflectance spectrum that Pajola et al. merged with the VSK-KRFM-ISM (Videospectrometric Camera (VSK)–Combined Radiometer and Photometer for Mars (KRFM)–Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (ISM) on board the USSR Phobos 2 spacecraft) spectra by Murchie \& Erard and the IRTF (NASA Infrared Telescope Facility, Hawaii, USA) spectra published by Rivkin et al. The OSIRIS data allow the characterization of an area of Phobos covering from 86.°8 N to 90° S in latitude and from 126° W to 286° W in longitude. This corresponds chiefly to the trailing hemisphere, but with a small sampling of the leading hemisphere as well. We compared the OSIRIS results with the Trojan D-type asteroid 624 Hektor and show that the overall slope and curvature of the two bodies over the common wavelength range are very similar. This favors Phobos being a captured D-type asteroid as previously suggested. We modeled the OSIRIS data using two models, the first one with a composition that includes organic carbonaceous material, serpentine, olivine, and basalt glass, and the second one consisting of Tagish Lake meteorite and magnesium-rich pyroxene glass. The results of these models were extended to longer wavelengths to compare the VSK-KRFM-ISM and IRTF data. The overall shape of the second model spectrum between 0.25 and 4.0 μm shows curvature and an albedo level that match both the OSIRIS and Murchie \& Erard data and the Rivkin et al. data much better than the first model. The large interval fit is encouraging and adds weight to this model, making it our most promising fit for Phobos. Since Tagish Lake is commonly used as a spectral analog for D-type asteroids, this provides additional support for compositional similarities between Phobos and D-type asteroids.},
